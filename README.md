## Hi :wave:
Hey there! I'm Zhou, a tech-savvy software engineer driven by my love for exploring cutting-edge technologies. Fresh out of the University of New South Wales with a BSc in Computer Science, I'm now taking my education to the next level with a standalone honours degree program.

Building products that make a difference in people's lives is my ultimate goal. I'm always on the hunt for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. With so many amazing projects I want to tackle, I'd love to collaborate with others to bring our shared visions to life. If you're looking for a partner to turn your ideas into realities, let's connect and create something truly awesome!

### Some projects I've worked on
- [LinkUp Events](https://linkupevents.com/) - A dedicated event tracker for events at UNSW. Browse upcoming events from 150+ societies, all in one place.
- [Arc Clubs Interface](https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/clubs) - Create a user interface for exploring over 300+ clubs, societies and community programs at UNSW.
