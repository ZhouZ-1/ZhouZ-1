### Hi :wave:
I'm Zhou, a software engineer with a passion for learning new technologies. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) from the University of New South Wales in 2022, and I'm currently pursuing further study in a standalone honours degree program.

I enjoy building things that people use, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. There are so many things I'd like to build but not enought time to do so by myself, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one with this issue. Want to work together to build something awesome? Send me a message and lets chat!

**Interests**: Front-end developement, competitive programming.

**Currently learning:** Rust, C++
