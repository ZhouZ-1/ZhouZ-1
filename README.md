## Hi :wave:
I'm Zhou, a software engineer with a passion for learning new technologies. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) from the University of New South Wales in 2022, and I'm currently pursuing further study in a standalone honours degree program.

I enjoy building things that people use, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. There are so many things I'd like to build but not enought time to do so by myself, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one with this issue. Want to work together to build something awesome? Send me a message and lets chat!

### Some projects I've worked on
- [LinkUp Events](https://linkupevents.com/) - A dedicated event tracker for events at UNSW. Browse upcoming events from 150+ societies, all in one place.
- [Arc Clubs Interface](https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/get-involved) - Create a user interface for exploring over 300+ clubs, societies and community programs at UNSW.
- [CSESoc Projects (Slackbot)](https://github.com/csesoc/community-slackbot) - A community slackbot to encourage participation with several useful tools and features.
- [Linkup Classic](https://old.linkupevents.com/) - The original Linkup website which was built near the end of my first year.
- [Personal Website](https://zzhou.dev/) - My personal webite for showcasing projects and practice frontend development.
- ...and several smaller projects. Details can be found [here](https://zzhou.dev/#projects)
